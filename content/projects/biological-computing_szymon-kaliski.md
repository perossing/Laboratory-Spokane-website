Szymon’s work in residence here at Laboratory has been working on tools to “grow out” shapes using biologically-inspired algorithms (boids simulation, algae growth, etc.). The tools (that will be open-sourced later) algorithmically generate 3d objects using signed distance functions, and then convert them into meshes using techniques like marching cubes and surface nets, to walk through the isosurface, and turn it into bunch of water-tight triangles (for possible 3d printing).

He’ll be talking about the uses of these tools, and be demoing some examples using data from Spokane!

This work is sponsored in part by a grant through Spokane Arts’ SAGA program.
