Laboratory’s mission is to provide practicing interactive artists with the time, space, and freedom to make awesome stuff.  So we want to offer you space to live, space to work, tools, mentorship, and connections to make that happen.

Our spring session runs from 01 March 2019 through 30 April 2019, and we’re accepting applications for 2 month residency periods within that time. We’d love to get yours; details on applying are on the How to Apply page, deadline is 10 November 2018.

If you wouldn’t love to come out, well there’s not much we can do about that. Sorry. :( Maybe sign up for our newsletter, and that’ll change your mind?

You’ll be sharing a 2 bedroom apartment in a historic building in downtown Spokane, Washington, with attached studio space below. We’ll provide the spaces and a small stipend, and in return, we expect you to work hard and put together at least one piece suitable for showing at in a public exhibition somewhere (don’t worry, you’ll still own the piece).

We accept applications on three tracks – one for artists wanting to work on a specific project, one for artists wanting to focus on researching new techniques/technologies, and one for emerging artists wanting to develop their technical skills. But, consider that a guideline for the sorts of things we support here, rather than a hard separation of programs – most projects involve elements of multiple tracks, so don’t get too caught up on ‘what track is my application’.
