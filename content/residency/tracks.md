Like we mentioned before, our program supports 3 specific tracks for artists:

## Production track
### aka “make something cool”

This track is focused on making something cool, interesting, and aesthetically pleasing. That project you’ve always wanted to do, but never had the time? This is the track for that. In your application, we’ll basically want you to describe what you want to build. Include a preliminary idea of the technologies you want to use and an initial schedule and/or timeline for your projects implementation. Please build in 2 weeks of buffer into your schedule, that is your schedule should be 2 weeks shorter than your intended period of residency. We all know how these projects go… ;)

## Research track
### aka “deep dive”
The research track is for people wanting to push forward the field of interactive art – this can mean lots of things, but overall, this is the track for you if you’re wanting to create new techniques, hack together new tools, or explore novel ways of interaction. Basically, if you’re looking to do anything that looks into ‘what is interaction’, ‘how can we make the world more interactive’, or ‘how do people react to interactive art’, we’d love to help you find some answers. For this track in particular it is important for us to have a clear understanding of your particular skill set. Your portfolio and and well documented examples of your previous work and/or progress is essential when applying for this track. We are especially interested in your previous research experience and any background research that pertains to your proposal. Depending on the nature of your work it may be useful to include a brief bibliography, works cited, and a list of the frameworks you intend to use.

## Learning track
### aka “develop your skills”
This track is for people who want to develop their skills in specific creative coding domains. Let us know what skills you want to learn! Your portfolio should reflect your style, and we’ll want to see samples of coding you’ve done as well. Please include a link to your GitHub page or send us some samples of code you’ve written. Also include an outline of how you plan on going about achieving what it is you want to learn. This is going to be the trickiest track for us to place, since it’s going to synergize the most with the other residents – if you want to learn Kinect, it’s probably the best if we’ve got someone working on Kinect stuff around, you know?
