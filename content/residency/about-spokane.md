So, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spokane,_Washington" target="_blank">Spokane</a>, huh?

If you’re stuck here for 1-3 months, doing like, a residency or something, what is there to do?

## Outdoorsy Stuff

Our city branding campaign is ‘Near Nature, Near Perfect’ for a reason. Our residency is literally 3 blocks away from the Centennial Trail, a huge walking/running/biking trail that follows the Spokane river and will take you into Idaho, if you feel so inclined. Riverfront Park is also 3 blocks away, if you’re more into manicured parks, and Riverside State Park is in easy biking distance (on the Centennial Trail) if you want to get into real nature from your doorstep.

Further afield, you’ll literally be across the street from the train station, and there’s a stop at Glacier National Park, considered by many to be the most beautiful place in the US. If you’re into snow sports, it’s less than an hour from couch to chairlift at Mount Spokane, and there’s 3 or 4 other (better) mountains within a 2 hour drive. Similarly, if you’re into hiking and camping, the mountains are to the right and the desert is to the left, and it’s all beautiful. There’s outdoor rock climbing within a 20 minute drive

## Indoorsy Stuff

There are a couple of new live music venues – you’ll be living above <a href="http://thebartlettspokane.com/" target="_blank">The Barlett</a>, where you’ll have tickets to all the shows, and there’s <a href="http://www.bigdipperprojects.com/" target="_blank">The Big Dipper</a> and there’ll be shows at the new Terrain space when that opens. There’s live music every night at <a href="http://www.zolainspokane.com/" target="_blank">Zola</a>, and bigger acts come to the <a href="https://sp.knittingfactory.com/" target="_blank">Knitting Factory</a> and <a href="http://www.spokanearena.com/index.php" target="_blank">Veteran’s Arena</a>.

Art-wise, when the new Terrain space opens up, that’ll be a pretty big hub, but there are a number of smaller galleries around town, including the <a href="http://experiencespokane.com/redskykolva/" target="_blank">Kolva-Sullivan Gallery</a>, the <a href="hhttps://www.visitspokane.com/listing/chase-gallery/12301/" target="_blank">Chase Gallery</a> in City Hall, and the <a href="http://www.saranacartprojects.org/" target="_blank">Saranac Art Projects</a>. Nearby Couer d’Alene is a bit of a drive away, and is kind of a resort-y town, but it has a number of commercial galleries as well.

Museum-wise, the <a href="https://www.northwestmuseum.org/" target="_blank">Northwest Museum of Arts and Culture</a> (the MAC) has been moving away from art into more history lately, but still puts on a good show. The new <a href="http://mobiusspokane.org/mobius-science-center" target="_blank">Mobius Science Center</a> is worth a visit, though – it’s really good, especially for a city the size of Spokane.

## Sports

Spokane hosts the world’s largest timed road (running) race, <a href="https://www.bloomsdayrun.org/" target="_blank">Bloomsday</a>, and running is super popular. The Centennial Trail is a beautiful place to run, and there are a couple downtown running groups that organize weekly runs, like the 500+ member strong Flying Irish. Spokane is also home to <a href="http://spokanehoopfest.net/" target="_blank">Hoopfest</a> in the summer, the world’s largest 3-on-3 basketball tournament, so there’s probably some pickup basketball going on somewhere. There’s a weekday Ultimate frisbee pickup game that we can hook you up with, and lots of easily accessible parks nearby for lawn game type activities.

If you’re more of a watcher instead of a do-er, we’ve got some pretty decent games to see, too. If you’re into football, the <a href="http://www.spokaneshock.com/" target="_blank">Spokane Shock</a> arena football team is super popular (and won the championship a few years back), and <a href="https://goeags.com/index.aspx?path=football" target="_blank">Eastern Washington University</a> fields a good team. We’ve got a AAA baseball team, the <a href="http://www.milb.com/index.jsp?sid=t486" target="_blank">Spokane Indians</a>, and you’ll be within walking distance of Gonzaga University, where the <a href="http://www.gozags.com/" target="_blank">athletic teams</a> vary from nationally competitive (basketball) to distinctly not competitive (probably everything else). We’ve also got <a href="http://www.spokanechiefs.com/" target="_blank">minor league hockey</a> in the winter at the arena, which is in walking distance.
