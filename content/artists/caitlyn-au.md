Caitlyn Au is a builder of virtual and architectural spaces. She is interested in virtuality as a state of being not-quite-real. Moving real events into fictional, virtual space, she reinterprets them through simulation and illusion. The resulting installations and digital environments operate in the shadow of the actual, entangling the immaterial and the corporeal.

She received a BFA in Glass from the Rhode Island School of Design and is originally from Portland, Oregon.
