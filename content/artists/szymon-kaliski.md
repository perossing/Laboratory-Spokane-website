I studied Computer Science at Pozna≈Ñ University of Technology, and Interactive Media at Adam Mickiewicz University.

I started by playing experimental music as a teenager, and it drove me to build my own tools to make music, then generative visuals, and finally interactive installations.

I treat my artistic activity as a practice of constant exploration of the medium I work in. I regularly build and publish new tools, that help me develop and build experimental projects, or allow me 
to explore new techniques.

I also make ambient/experimental music from deconstructed acoustic sounds, combining lo-fi techniques with new digital technologies. I constantly search for individual methods of expression, using self-made software and unique hardware. My tracks are intentionally filled with imperfections, full of cracks suspended in slowed down soundscapes. Compositions are always born from acoustic sounds - looped, decayed and reconstructed.
