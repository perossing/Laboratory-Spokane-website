Our vision of a residency is to provide time to focus somewhat monomaniacally on a project or idea in a space that gives you some distance from the stress and bustle of normal life. Practically, this means that we ask our residents to mostly be free of other work during this time.

One of the things we try and do here is build a sense of community between our residents in a given cohort, and actually living together is an important element of that.
