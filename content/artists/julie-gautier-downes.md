Julie Gautier-Downes is an installation artist and photographer currently based in Spokane, Washington. She holds a MFA from the Rhode Island School of Design in Photography and a BA from the University of California, Santa Cruz. In 2015, she won Best In Show for her installation in Guess You Had To Be There at the Peoria Gateway Building. In 2016, she won Best Still Life in the Florida Museum of Photographic Arts’ 2016 International Photography Competition and was awarded a Grants for Artist Projects (GAP) 2016 Grant from the Artist Trust. Gautier-Downes has exhibited her work in solo and group shows across the United States and Europe. She has been an Artist in Residence at AIR Studio Paducah, the Richmond Art Collective, and the Vermont Studio Center. Gautier-Downes’ studio practice revolves around the investigation of somatic traces left in disused domestic spaces that become artifacts of the past. The domestic vestiges that haunt these spaces are transformed into a narrative waiting to be deciphered.
