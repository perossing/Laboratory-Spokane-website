Liza Stark is a designer, educator, and multi-disciplinary artist based in New York whose work explores how craft, technology, and play impact how we learn as individuals and communities. Her research interests include the personal, ethical, and privacy implications of wearable technology and data; sustainable eTextiles (considering material awareness, labor implications, and interventions in current consumer behaviors); recrafting rituals, narratives, and traditions through computationally enhanced objects; soft interface design and the creation of open toolkits to facilitate their development, electronic craft as a tool and pathway to learning programming.
Currently, she teaches in the MFA Design + Technology program at Parsons and is a research fellow at the t.LAB in the Brooklyn Design + Fashion Accelerator at the Pratt Institute. Past adventures include leading the community team at littleBits, designing games and playful professional development at Institute of Play, and facilitating many workshops for all sorts of people on electronics, eTextiles, design, and games. Her work has been shown at the International Symposium on Wearable Computers, NYCxDESIGN Week, Moulins Paillard, Maker Faire, Open Hardware Summit, CIANT, the Tangible, Embedded, and Embodied Interfaces Conference, and more.
She takes play very seriously, loves her sewing machine and soldering iron equally, and considers open knowledge sharing as important as breathing.
