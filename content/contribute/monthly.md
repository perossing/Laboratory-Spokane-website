Join us in making awesome happen every day. Donate monthly, and help us do things like:

* **$5/month** would let us take all of our residents to the local Museum of Art and Culture while they’re here
* **$10/month** could buy a season’s worth of heating, cooling, and light for one of our residents, so they don’t freeze to death
* **$25/month** can become ropes, sensors, paint – enough to support the all the materials a single artist uses every month
* **$50/month** could provide for a big piece of equipment every year – a new projector, a PC, a VR headset, or 24,503 Tootsie Rolls
* **$75/month** could pay rent for a resident’s entire 2-month stay
