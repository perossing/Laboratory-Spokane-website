Thanks for wanting to help us out! We’re always looking for people who want to be involved with the work we’re doing, from helping introduce our residents to Spokane to helping set up the shows.

We’re currently extra-specially looking for people interested in helping out with the following things:

* **Project Facilitation** – helping artists make projects, helping them organize shows
* **Welcome Committee** – Help introduce residents to Spokane and our community
* **Call Support** – Run our calls for artists, spreading word about application periods, assembling juries, and selecting artists
* **Quartermaster** – Help keep our equipment organized and maintained

Either way, if you’re interested in getting involved, drop an e-mail to <a href="mailto:chatham@laboratoryspokane.com">chatham@laboratoryspokane.com</a> – we’d love to figure out how you can be a part of what we’re doing!
