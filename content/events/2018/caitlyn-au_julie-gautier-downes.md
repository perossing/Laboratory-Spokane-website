Opening reception for two new shows! Julie has been working on “Seriation of Distress”, a set of tiny houses modeled on local abandoned properties, and invites you to join in the final part of her work – thoughtless vandalism!

Meanwhile, Portland-based Caitlyn Au’s “Nondescript” uses architectural materials and shapes to explore our socialized acceptance of ‘necessary violence’ and our acceptance of force to keep order.

This work is sponsored in part by a grant through Spokane Arts’ SAGA program.
