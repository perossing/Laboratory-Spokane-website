## Become a Monthly Donor

Join us in making awesome happen every day. Donate monthly, and help us do things like:

* $5/month would let us take all of our residents to the local Museum of Art and Culture while they’re here
* $10/month could buy a season’s worth of heating, cooling, and light for one of our residents, so they don’t freeze to death
* $25/month can become ropes, sensors, paint – enough to support the all the materials a single artist uses every month
* $50/month could provide for a big piece of equipment every year – a new projector, a PC, a VR headset, or 24,503 Tootsie Rolls
* $75/month could pay rent for a resident’s entire 2 month stay

## One-Time Donations

Not in a place to commit to giving monthly? Looking to support us for a specific thing? Did you find some pirate gold, but it’s cursed, so now you need to give it away before the darkness completely takes over? Make a one-time donation, and feel the weight of a 300 years old nautical hex lift from your shoulders.
